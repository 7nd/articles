# Introduction

## What is QOR?

QOR is basically everything we need to run a full e-commerce website. But what
interests us here is the admin interface. Let's say we're creating an API
and store our data (stuff like your users, products, etc...) in a database. You
just don't need QOR to do that, you can use whatever router you're used to work
with for example. But QOR is a full framework, if you want to look at everything
it can do, head to the [getqor website](https://getqor.com/) and be prepared to 
be amazed because it can do so many things:

Although this article isn't sponsored by QOR or anything like that, I think it's
a great piece of technology and the people behind it are quite amazing. They
even have an [enterprise package](https://getqor.com/en/enterprise)!

## QOR Admin?

Frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) give you an admin
interface to manage your data. This is great because it allows you to display
data in a web interface, modify it or execute one-shot actions on some
records. For example, it's rather easy to create a CSV export of one of your
tables in the form a single button that any admin can click on, thus avoiding
the usual SQL query to export data, if you know what I mean.

It also enables to modify data and more importantly **keep it consistent** by
writing your business rules as part of your admin interface. So we can prevent
someone from modifying one of our products and set the price to $0 (or 0â‚¬, or
whatever the currency, you get my point). Or prevent data loss. Or set specific
behavior for certain fields. The admin interface use-case is then completely
different from a dashboard that does only "read" operations to generate insights
like [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) (which is an amazing tool too!).

So QOR Admin is a component of the QOR stack. And the great news is: You don't
need the whole QOR stack to make QOR Admin work! Plus, let's face it, QOR Admin
is really gorgeous with its material design theme (but that's subjective). The
following screenshot is from the [QOR Admin Demo](http://demo.getqor.com/admin):

![qor admin demo](/assets/qor-admin/qor-admin-demo.png)

## Motivations

Although QOR Admin is an amazing open-source lib and product, sometimes the
documentation lacks a clear way to do things. This article's goal is to act
as a kind of enhanced documentation and tutorial. We'll try to leverage the
annoying steps of setting up QOR following its best practices and create some
kind of package that could be reused quickly without having to overthink things.

# Initial Setup

QOR (in general and not just admin) is tightly coupled with
[gorm](https://gorm.io), mostly because gorm is an amazing ORM for the Go
language, and also because [jinzhu](https://github.com/jinzhu) who created gorm
also helped creating QOR. The main issue here is that if you're not already
using gorm, you might have a hard time using it "only" for the admin interface.
For this reason we won't cover the case where you're not already using gorm for
your API or web service.

This section's goal is to provide a basic example of how to use QOR Admin and
Gorm. We'll be using this example throughout the article but if you already
have a use-case where you're connected to a database using gorm and already have
some tables in there with the associated structs you can skip this part
entirely.

## PostgreSQL

We'll first create our database and we will be using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
with the [uuid-ossp](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/uuid-ossp.html)
extension to generate UUID as primary key. This is mostly useless for this
example, but it's always nice to see another way of generating primary keys than
a simple `uint`.

```sql
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE qor_tutorial;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# CREATE USER qor WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGE ON DATABASE qor_tutorial TO qor;
GRANT
postgres=# \c qor_tutorial
qor_tutorial=# CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA public;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

## Base Program

Let's get started by creating a base program which we'll then use as a reference
for the rest of the article. In this snippet we'll do two things:

- Define a struct that is understandable by gorm
- Connect to the database we created earlier

```go
package main

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
	_ "github.com/jinzhu/gorm/dialects/postgres"
	uuid "github.com/satori/go.uuid"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

type product struct {
	ID        uuid.UUID `gorm:"primary_key;type:uuid;default:uuid_generate_v4()"`
	CreatedAt time.Time
	UpdatedAt time.Time
	DeletedAt *time.Time

	Name  string
	Price int
}

func main() {
	var db *gorm.DB
	var err error
	if db, err = gorm.Open(
		"postgres",
		"user=qor dbname=qor_tutorial password=password sslmode=disable",
	); err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Fatal("Couldn't initialize database connection")
	}
	defer db.Close()
}
```

This is a minimal example and this post isn't about gorm itself but about QOR
so we'll keep things simple. If you need more information on how to
use gorm, please refer to my [Gorm Gotchas](/post/gorm-gotchas) post. 

We'll add a few migrations which you can find in
[the code associated to this post](https://github.com/Depado/articles/blob/master/code/qor/v1/migrations/).
These migrations (`uuidCheck` and `initial`) are used to check if the
`uuid-ossp` extension exists in the database we're connecting to, and to create
our `products` table. Simply import the `migrate` package and run:

```go
if err = migrate.Start(db); err != nil {
	logrus.WithError(err).Fatal("Couldn't run migration")
}
```

So we have a database and a model. Now we just want to add QOR Admin. But we
want to use the [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) router, so let's head to
[the QOR documentation](https://doc.getqor.com/admin/integration.html#integrate-with-gin)
and find out how we can use QOR Admin with it.

```go
adm := admin.New(&admin.AdminConfig{SiteName: "Admin", DB: db})
mux := http.NewServeMux()
adm.MountTo("/admin", mux)

r := gin.New()
r.Any("/admin/*resources", gin.WrapH(mux))
r.Run("127.0.0.1:8080")
```

## Adding Resource

Now let's add our `product` model to our new admin interface:

```go
// imports, db connection, etc.

adm := admin.New(&admin.AdminConfig{SiteName: "Admin", DB: db})
adm.AddResource(&product{})

// mux, gin, etc.
```

We can now head to `127.0.0.1:8080/admin` to see our admin interface in action!

![products](/assets/qor-admin/product.gif)

That's it. Now our product model is successfully registered with QOR, we can
interact with the data in our database, add/delete/edit products.

# Authentication

![lock](/assets/qor-admin/lock.gif)

Now we have a nice looking admin interface which integrates our model and allows
us to modify data in our database. But there's no authentication in front of it,
which is seriously problematic. Luckily, after a quick search on
[QOR's Documentation](https://doc.getqor.com/) we find a page about
authentication [here](https://doc.getqor.com/admin/authentication.html)!

We're told that we need to implement an interface. Well ok. How are we supposed
to do that? Well we need to understand how a simple auth system works, cookies,
forms and other stuff like that. So let's get started.

## Admin User Model

The goal here is to create another table which will only contain our admin users
for our admin interface (people that are allowed to login and do things).
We don't need a really complex one, just enough to identify people connecting
on our admin interface, so let's go with something like that:

```go
// AdminUser defines how an admin user is represented in database
type AdminUser struct {
	gorm.Model
	Email     string `gorm:"not null;unique"`
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Password  []byte
	LastLogin *time.Time
}
```

Basic really. Email, name, password and last login operation. Security people
I see you, don't worry, the password won't be clear text. We're not barbarians.
So we're going to add a few methods:

```go
// DisplayName satisfies the interface for Qor Admin
func (u AdminUser) DisplayName() string {
	if u.FirstName != "" && u.LastName != "" {
		return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s", u.FirstName, u.LastName)
	}
	return u.Email
}

// HashPassword is a simple utility function to hash the password sent via API
// before inserting it in database
func (u *AdminUser) HashPassword() error {
    pwd, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(u.Password, bcrypt.DefaultCost)
    if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	u.Password = pwd
	return nil
}

// CheckPassword is a simple utility function to check the password given as raw
// against the user's hashed password
func (u AdminUser) CheckPassword(raw string) bool {
	return bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword(u.Password, []byte(raw)) == nil
}
```

The `DisplayName()` method will be used by QOR to display the user's name in the
admin interface, or its email address if the `FirstName` and `LastName` fields
are not filled. And we'll use `bcrypt` to hash our passwords. Now we need to 
create that table and add our first user.

## Migration

If you read my previous post about gorm, you might know that I'm using a package
called [gormigrate](https://github.com/go-gormigrate/gormigrate) to handle
database migrations. This package is really useful because it allows to run
migrations and more importantly, to rollback if they fail. As I wrote in my
previous article, embedding your model inside the migration ensures the
migrations can be run in the right order even if you modify the main `AdminUser`
model. So let's create our table, and immediately add our first admin user
with its email address and a `changeme` password.

```go
import (
	"time"

	"github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt"
	gormigrate "gopkg.in/gormigrate.v1"
)

var initAdmin = &gormigrate.Migration{
	ID: "init_admin",
	Migrate: func(tx *gorm.DB) error {
		var err error

		type adminUser struct {
			gorm.Model
			Email     string `gorm:"not null;unique"`
			FirstName string
			LastName  string
			Password  []byte
			LastLogin *time.Time
		}

		if err = tx.CreateTable(&adminUser{}).Error; err != nil {
			return err
		}
		var pwd []byte
		if pwd, err = bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte("changeme"), bcrypt.DefaultCost); err != nil {
			return err
		}
		usr := adminUser{
			Email:    "youremailaddress@yourcompany.com",
			Password: pwd,
		}
		return tx.Save(&usr).Error
	},
	Rollback: func(tx *gorm.DB) error {
		return tx.DropTable("admin_users").Error
	},
}
```

## Admin User in Admin

If everything went well, you now have a new table called `admin_users` which
only contains one single record, the user you created in the migration. We're
going to add the `AdminUser` model to our admin interface **but** we need to
define the behavior intended for the `Password` field. QOR Admin is great but
if you don't tell it what to do with the data, it just puts it there. Meaning:
a clear text password if we modify our user in the admin interface and save it.

This is where QOR Admin can get tricky. We'll be using the `adm` variable
that we created earlier in the minimal initial code. When you use `AddResource`
it returns a `*Resource` that can be fully customized. In the following code
snippet we're going to define the behavior of the `Password` field. First we're
going to remove this field from the index view (the list of our users), and then
we're going to use `Meta` to change the way it is displayed as well as its
default behavior. 

```go
usr := adm.AddResource(&AdminUser{}, &admin.Config{Menu: []string{"User Management"}})
usr.IndexAttrs("-Password")
usr.Meta(&admin.Meta{
	Name: "Password",
	Type: "password",
	Setter: func(resource interface{}, metaValue *resource.MetaValue, context *qor.Context) {
		values := metaValue.Value.([]string)
		if len(values) > 0 {
			if np := values[0]; np != "" {
				pwd, err := bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(np), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
				if err != nil {
					context.DB.AddError(validations.NewError(usr, "Password", "Can't encrypt password")) // nolint: gosec,errcheck
					return
				}
				u := resource.(*AdminUser)
				u.Password = pwd
			}
		}
	},
})
```

Well... The first two lines are pretty explicit. But the `Meta` function needs
a little more attention. First, we declare that this meta information is about
the `Password` field, and we define its type, it's a password field so it should
be displayed like one. 

Now the `Setter`. The setter is a function that is executed when a record is
edited or created. The first thing to do is to check if there is a changed
value or not. By checking the length of `values` (which needs to be type 
asserted to a slice of string, because `resource.MetaValue` has many other uses)
we know if that field has been modified (or filled in the case of a new record)
or not. Then, **in that specific case** we know there's only one value because
it's a password input (so there can only be one value, the password).

Once we checked all that and got the actual value that was filled in the input,
we can use bcrypt to hash the password. If there's an error, QOR has its own
way of handling it, we need to add said error to the `context.DB` that will
be displayed to our user if it's not empty at the end of the query (meaning, you
can add more than one throughout your setter). 

And once all that is done, we type assert that the resource is of type 
`AdminUser` and we set its `Password` field to the new password we just
hashed.

## Authentication with Gin

### QOR Admin's expectations

Now we have a database that contains both our application data (our products)
and our admin users. What we need to do is allow a user to login, thus 
implementing the interface QOR Admin expects. This interface is composed
of three functions:

```go
type Auth interface {
  GetCurrentUser(*Context) qor.CurrentUser // get current user, if don't have permission, then return nil
  LoginURL(*Context) string // get login url, if don't have permission, will redirect to this url
  LogoutURL(*Context) string // get logout url, if click logout link from admin interface, will visit this page
}
```

The `LoginURL` and `LogoutURL` are not complex to implement, we'll just tell
QOR where it should redirect users that are not authenticated or want to logout.
The last function we need to implement, on the other hand, is going to define
how we'll identify users. For this, we'll use 
[gin-contrib/sessions](https://github.com/gin-contrib/sessions) with a cookie 
backend. We're going to define a few things now:

- The session name: it can be anything, as long as it doesn't collide with 
another session.
- The thing we'll store in the cookie to identify the user: Let's store its ID.

We also need an access to our database connection to check if the password is
correct or even if the user exists. 

```go
type auth struct {
	db      *gorm.DB
	session sessionConfig
	paths   pathConfig
}

type sessionConfig struct {
	name  string
	key   string
	store cookie.Store
}

type pathConfig struct {
	login  string
	logout string
	admin  string
}

// GetCurrentUser satisfies the Auth interface and returns the current user
func (a auth) GetCurrentUser(c *admin.Context) qor.CurrentUser {
	var userid uint

	s, err := a.session.store.Get(c.Request, a.session.name)
	if err != nil {
		return nil
	}
	if v, ok := s.Values[a.session.key]; ok {
		userid = v.(uint)
	} else {
		return nil
	}

	var user models.AdminUser
	if !a.db.First(&user, "id = ?", userid).RecordNotFound() {
		return &user
	}

	return nil
}

// LoginURL statisfies the Auth interface and returns the route used to log
// users in
func (a auth) LoginURL(c *admin.Context) string { // nolint: unparam
	return a.paths.login
}

// LogoutURL statisfies the Auth interface and returns the route used to logout
// a user
func (a auth) LogoutURL(c *admin.Context) string { // nolint: unparam
	return a.paths.logout
}
```

There. Now, **if there is a session** containing a user ID that actually exists
in our database, we're good to go and QOR can safely give access to the admin
interface. But how are we going to create said session? And allow users to
login?

### Gin Endpoints

In order to properly handle our session, we're going to need three endpoints:

- GET /login - Renders a template with a login form
- POST /login - Handles the form submission and checks data in database
- GET /logout - Destroys the session and redirects to /login

We can reuse our Auth structure because it already embeds the database, session
and everything we need for those three endpoints. We'll see the login template
in the next section, let's just see what it looks like from the backend point
of view:

```go
// GetLogin simply returns the login page
func (a *auth) GetLogin(c *gin.Context) {
	if sessions.Default(c).Get(a.session.key) != nil {
		c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.admin)
		return
	}
	c.HTML(http.StatusOK, "login", gin.H{})
}

// PostLogin is the handler to check if the user can connect
func (a *Auth) PostLogin(c *gin.Context) {
	session := sessions.Default(c)
	email := c.PostForm("email")
	password := c.PostForm("password")
	if email == "" || password == "" {
		c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.login)
		return
	}
	var u models.AdminUser
	if a.db.Where(&models.AdminUser{Email: email}).First(&u).RecordNotFound() {
		c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.login)
		return
	}
	if !u.CheckPassword(password) {
		c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.login)
		return
	}

	now := time.Now()
	u.LastLogin = &now
	a.db.Save(&u)

	session.Set(a.session.key, u.ID)
	err := session.Save()
	if err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Warn("Couldn't save session")
		c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.login)
		return
	}
	c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.admin)
}

// GetLogout allows the user to disconnect
func (a *Auth) GetLogout(c *gin.Context) {
	session := sessions.Default(c)
	session.Delete(a.session.key)
	if err := session.Save(); err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Warn("Couldn't save session")
	}
	c.Redirect(http.StatusSeeOther, a.paths.login)
}
```

When the user submits the form with its credentials, the endpoint checks in the
database if the user exists and if the provided password matches the one stored
in database. If both conditions match, then we update the `LastLogin` field of
our user, save it in database, update its session and redirects it to the admin 
interface endpoint. Upon reaching this endpoint, the `GetCurrentUser` function
is executed and now returns our user because it has the proper session values,
thus granting access to the admin.

### Login Template

Please refer to the HTML file located [here](https://github.com/Depado/articles/tree/master/code/qor/v1/templates/login.html)
and place it in a `templates` directory.

### Wrapping things up

Now that things are getting a bit complicated with all that code floating around
let's wrap things up and organize our stuff.

- Move your `Product` and `AdminUser` structs in a `models` package.
- Move your `Auth` struct with all its methods in an `admin` package.
- Move your migrations in a `migrate` package (or wherever you like really)

The structure of your directory should look like this by now:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ admin
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ auth.go
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ migrate
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ initial.go
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ migrate.go
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ user.go
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ uuid.go
â””â”€â”€ models
    â”œâ”€â”€ product.go
    â””â”€â”€ user.go
```

Now let's add a `admin/admin.go` file in which put our admin definition and
another extra structure:

```

```

# Deployment and Bindatafs

This part was tricky. As in, really tricky and it took me a lot of time to
actually understand what was going on.
