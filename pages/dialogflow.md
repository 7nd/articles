# Introduction

This article has two goals. The first one is to grasp the global view of how
DialogFlow works and more precisely, how it integrates with a webhook. The
second one is to teach you how to create a Go webhook.

If you already know what DialogFlow is and how to use it (for example creating
the agent, intents, entities, follow-up, etcâ€¦) you can skip directly to the
"Writing a webhook" section. This guide will use the **v2 version of the 
DialogFlow API**.

What we'll see in this tutorial :

- What is DialogFlow and what it is used for
- How to create an agent in DialogFlow from scratch
- What's a webhook and how it is integrated with DialogFlow
- Tips and tricks on how to write a webhook in Go

Basically this article will be a complete guide on how to create a chatbot with
a Go webhook.

# DialogFlow

## What is DialogFlow ?

![dialogflow-logo](/assets/dialogflow/dialogflow-logo.png)

DialogFlow is a tool that does [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing)
and can be used to detect keywords and intents in a user's sentence. Its role is
to help building chatbots using [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
All you need to do is provide a set of sentences a user could potentially say,
highlight the parameters you want to retrieve and let DialogFlow do its work.

DialogFlow allows you to ask questions to users, display rich messages (such
as cards, carousels, quick responses, etc) and it supports a wide range of 
[integrations](https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/). You can create a
complete conversational chatbot without having to write a single line of code !
How great is that ? 

## Integrations

As stated earlier, DialogFlow supports a wide range of integrations which means
it knows how to communicate with various services such as Facebook Messenger,
Actions on Google, Skype, etc. Which means your agent will work with every one
of these platforms if you setup the integrations properly. 

## Webhook for DialogFlow

Now that we know what DialogFlow can do, one may ask "How do I create a useful
chatbot with some complex actions ?". Well that's where the webhook is handy.
Indeed everytime DialogFlow matches an intent, you have the possibility to
ask DialogFlow to send a request to a specific endpoint. Endpoint which you'll
obviously have to code. 

That will allow you to retrieve the matched intent, as well as the matched
parameters and contexts, and do some useful work with those. The demo weather
agent for example is rather dumb and doesn't do much. It won't display the
weather, unless there's a webhook that can send back the weather to the user.

# Creating an agent

## Getting started

There are loads of tutorials on internet on how to get started with DialogFlow.
So follow one of them and create a new agent. **Remember to activate the v2
API before creating the agent !**

Now that you have your new agent, what to do ? We'll need to do several things
before going to the webhook section, and that implies the basics of DialogFlow.

## Intents 

First we'll need at least one [intent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents). 
An intent represents what the user is trying to do. When DialogFlow receives 
what the user just said or wrote, it will try to detect the user's intent, 
what he's trying to achieve. But DialogFlow doesn't use black magic to do so, 
it needs training data. So let's say you want to create a chatbot that can 
search for a cocktail. We're going to use 
[this API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

We'll start with a simple intent. The `Random` intent will match whenever
DialogFlow detects a certain type of sentence. Your user might just say 
something like "Give me a random cocktail recipe". We'll achieve this by giving 
DialogFlow **training phrases**.

![random](/assets/dialogflow/random-intent.png)

Now let's imagine the user says something like "I'm looking for a alcohol-free
cocktail with coke in it". That won't match with our `Random` intent.
We're going to tell DialogFlow how to parse this so it makes sense to it. We'll 
need to tell it to match "alcohol-free", "cocktail" and "coke" so it can send 
these information to our webhook.

![search](/assets/dialogflow/search-intent.png)

You'll notice a few things here. First, the `@sys.any` parameter will be the 
name of the cocktail the user wants, it's not present in every sentences. It's 
because we're simply giving DialogFlow examples of what the user might say.
Second, there are two extra entities in the parameters table : `alcohol` and
`drink-type`. If you followed this guide to this point you can't yet use those 
entities as they are not defined in your agent. Head to the next section to see 
how to create them.

Here's an example of how it would work :

![result](/assets/dialogflow/search-result.png)

The phrase the user said on the right section of the screenshot isn't defined
in our training phrases. Yet, DialogFlow knows it's the `Search` intent and
knows that `mojito` refers to a cocktail name. 

![amazed2](/assets/dialogflow/amazed-2.gif)

## Entities

As [the docs](https://dialogflow.com/docs/entities) define them : 

> Entities are powerful tools used for extracting parameter values from natural 
> language inputs. Any important data you want to get from a user's request, 
> will have a corresponding entity.

Entities are the "things" you want to match. For example here is the `alcohol`
entity that we saw earlier in our intent definition :

![entity](/assets/dialogflow/alcohol-entity.png)

Simple, right ? We simply define a set of terms that will match a single value
(synonyms) when our user use them in a sentence. This is very important for the
webhook part, because the value on the left, is what your webhook will see if
that entity is matched in your user's sentence.

For now you can improve your agent by adding phrases that the user could say,
and test it out in the console on the right, see if your intent is matched and
check if the parameters are filled correctly.

## Follow-Up Intents

So for now your user can trigger two intents, one will randomly pick a cocktail
and one that will effectively search a cocktail that matches the users's 
preferences. There's no logic behind it yet, we'll see that in the Webhook
section.

Let's see how we could make our agent behave properly and accept that the user
modifies his original request. For that we'll create a [follow-up intent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/intents#follow_up_intents).

![followup](/assets/dialogflow/followup-search.png)

A follow-up intent will be triggered if the user first matched the parent intent
and not in any other case. So we want our conversation to look like this :

"Can you give me the recipe of a cocktail without alcohol ?  
- Sure thing. I found a cocktail named 'Virgin Mojito'. Would you like me to
read you the recipe or do you want to modify your search ?  
- Show me something with alcohol instead."

It should keep the fact that the user wants a cocktail and not a basic drink
but modify the fact that it's a non-alcoholic cocktail. To achieve that, 
DialogFlow uses what's called [contexts](https://dialogflow.com/docs/contexts).

As you may have noticed, your `Search` intent now outputs a `Search-followup`
context. And your `Search Specify` receives this context. Which means every
information the user filled in the first intent is also available to this
intent.

# Webhook : Introduction

## Where's the Go SDK ?

So you've started to work on DialogFlow. Your agent is behaving correctly, and
now you want to create a webhook to add some logic behind it. You head to the
[SDKs](https://dialogflow.com/docs/sdks) part of the documentation and as you
scroll down the page, you realize there's no support for the Go language. And
especially not for the v2 version of the API which only supports three 
languages at the time of writing : Java, Python and Node.js.

But after all, you just want to wrap a small piece of the DialogFlow API, which
is : Receiving a JSON payload and responding with another JSON payload. 
So you start writing your own package and end up in the 
[WebhookRequest](https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/api-v2/rest/v2beta1/WebhookRequest)
section of the documentation. And suddenly it doesn't look so easy.

So I wrote a package that will make your life easier :

<div class="github-card" data-user="leboncoin" data-repo="dialogflow-go-webhook"></div>
<script src="http://lab.lepture.com/github-cards/widget.js"></script>

You can follow the instructions in the 
[README](https://github.com/leboncoin/dialogflow-go-webhook#dialogflow-go-webhook)
to install this package. The rest of this tutorial will reference this package
as `df` in the Go code snippets.

## Setup

We're going to use [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
as our HTTP router, since it has some nice helper functions, is minimalist
and blazing fast. 

Let's start by a simple Gin router that has a single route.

```go
func webhook(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.POST("/webhook", webhook)
	if err := r.Run("127.0.0.1:8001"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

To test and develop your webhook, I'd recommend you use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
Your server will be listening on `127.0.0.1:8001` so simply execute the 
following command to start ngrok :

```sh
$ ngrok http 8080
```

Then check the `Forwarding` line, copy the URL that ngrok gave you and go to 
the **Fulfillment** section of your DialogFlow agent. Paste the URL and save.
Then head to the intent you want to activate your webhook for and check the 
box to enable the webhook call :

![fulfillment](/assets/dialogflow/fulfillment.png)

Remember to save, and wait for the agent to finish training. Modify your webhook
so you can parse what DialogFlow sends you. 

## Incoming Request

![flow](/assets/dialogflow/flow.svg)

When DialogFlow detects an intent it will send a complex JSON object to your
webhook. And there's only one webhook for all the intents. So we're going to
filter and route on what is called the `action`. 

![df-action](/assets/dialogflow/action.png)

You can either set this to the value you want, or simply let DialogFlow generate
the action's name for you. 

```go
func webhook(c *gin.Context) {
	var err error
	var dfr *df.Request

	if err = c.BindJSON(&dfr); err != nil {
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
    }

    spew.Dump(dfr)

    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
}
```

I recommend to use the [spew](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew)
package to display the full structure.
You'll see that some fields are raw bytes. Since we only have one webhook route
for the whole agent, parameters and context's data structure might change 
according to the intent that matched. 

## Routing on the action

We're now able to receive the request DialogFlow sends to our webhook, thus
we can route on the `action` field. This will allow us to receive different
parameters and contexts depending on which intent matched.

```go
func webhook(c *gin.Context) {
	var err error
	var dfr *df.Request

	if err = c.BindJSON(&dfr); err != nil {
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}
	
	switch dfr.QueryResult.Action {
	case "search":
		log.Println("Search action detected")
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
	case "random":
		log.Println("Search action detected")
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
	default:
		log.Println("Unknown action")
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusNotFound)
	}
}
```

We have two different behaviors here. The `Random` intent doesn't send
parameters, whereas the `Search` one sends the various parameters we defined in
our intent. Let's add two functions :

```go
func search(c *gin.Context, dfr *df.Request) {

}

func random(c *gin.Context, dfr *df.Request) {

}
```

# Webhook : Random intent

## Getting a random cocktail

The subject here isn't how to create an API client. So I created one here : 
[github.com/Depado/articles/code/dialogflow/cocktail](https://github.com/Depado/articles/tree/master/code/dialogflow/cocktail).

We'll use that package when our `random(*gin.Context, *df.Request)` function
is called. We don't need to retrieve parameters or contexts here, it's just
a random cocktail and we don't let the user specify anything.

```go
func random(c *gin.Context, dfr *df.Request) {
	var err error
	var d *cocktail.FullDrink

	if d, err = cocktail.C.GetRandomDrink(); err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Error("Coudln't get random drink")
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(d)
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
}
```

Let's try and ask our DialogFlow agent for a random drink in the test console.
Your webhook should receive the request and properly call your `random` function.
Now we'll need to format the response so DialogFlow understands what the webhook
responds.

## Sending back a rich message

### Just a line of spoken text and written text

Once we get the random drink we'll send back what's called a `Fulfillment`.

```go
out := fmt.Sprintf("I found that cocktail : %s", d.StrDrink)
dff := &df.Fulfillment{
	FulfillmentMessages: df.Messages{
		{RichMessage: df.Text{Text: []string{out}}},
		df.ForGoogle(df.SingleSimpleResponse(out, out)),
	},
}
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, dff)
```

Let's try to ask the DialogFlow agent for a random drink again. Surprise, now
it will output something like : "I found that cocktail : Daiquiri"

![amazed](/assets/dialogflow/amazed.gif)

The `FulfillmentMessages` is what we'll use to send back data to the user, and
it is a slice of `df.Message` (aliased as `df.Messages`).

```go
// Message is a struct holding a platform and a RichMessage.
// Used in the FulfillmentMessages of the response sent back to dialogflow
type Message struct {
	Platform
	RichMessage RichMessage
}
```

Message is composed of two fields, the first one is the platform. This
information is used by DialogFlow to send platform-specific messages to the
user. Which means you can send back a different message if the user is on
messenger or on Actions on Google for example. Platforms are defined like this :

```go
// Platform is a simple type intended to be used with responses
type Platform string

// Platform constants, used in the webhook responses
const (
	Unspecified     Platform = "PLATFORM_UNSPECIFIED"
	Facebook        Platform = "FACEBOOK"
	Slack           Platform = "SLACK"
	Telegram        Platform = "TELEGRAM"
	Kik             Platform = "KIK"
	Skype           Platform = "SKYPE"
	Line            Platform = "LINE"
	Viber           Platform = "VIBER"
	ActionsOnGoogle Platform = "ACTIONS_ON_GOOGLE"
)
```

When no platform is specified, DialogFlow will interpret it
as its own response. This example uses two helper functions :

- `df.ForGoogle` : Simply sets the `Platform` field to `df.ActionsOnGoogle` and
takes a `RichMessage` as argument.
- `df.SingleSimpleResponse` takes two strings, one for the spoken text and one
for the written text and will format it nicely.

### Sending back a card for Actions on Google

Let's add a function that takes a `*cocktail.FullDrink` and turns it into a
`df.BasicCard` :

```go
func cardFromDrink(d *cocktail.FullDrink) df.BasicCard {
	card := df.BasicCard{
		Title:         d.StrDrink,
		FormattedText: d.StrInstructions,
		Image: &df.Image{
			ImageURI: d.StrDrinkThumb,
		},
	}
	return card
}
```

And modify the fulfillment our random function sends back :

```go
out := fmt.Sprintf("I found that cocktail : %s", d.StrDrink)
dff := &df.Fulfillment{
	FulfillmentMessages: df.Messages{
		{RichMessage: df.Text{Text: []string{out}}},
		df.ForGoogle(cardFromDrink(d)),
	},
}
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, dff)
```

# Webhook : Search intent

## Difference between Parameters and Contexts

One of the first things you must understand is that parameters and contexts
are completely different. Parameters are what a specific intent understood from
the user input. Which means that if you're working with more than one intent,
and more specifically with follow-up intents, parameters won't contain
everything DialogFlow understood from a conversation, but rather what it
understood in a specific sentence. Two cases here :

- Your webhook only responds to one intent. In this case, you can work with
parameters it doesn't matter. You'll get every piece of information you need.
- Your webhook integrates in a conversation. In this case, work with contexts as
they'll contain the parameters matched by many intents. 

If you work only with parameters you'll need to rewrite every parameter for
every intent. Which makes your workflow complex since you can't change a
parameter without changing it in every intent that uses it. 

This will be the case for every follow-up intents.

## Retrieving parameters 

Our `Random` intent works well now. Let's switch to the `Search` intent. First
we're going to define a structure that we'll unmarshal the parameters to. We
will then use the function [`(*Request) GetParams(i interface{}) error`](https://godoc.org/github.com/leboncoin/dialogflow-go-webhook#Request.GetParams)
to retrieve
those.

```go
type searchParams struct {
	Alcohol   string `json:"alcohol"`
	DrinkType string `json:"drink-type"`
	Name      string `json:"name"`
}

func search(c *gin.Context, dfr *df.Request) {
	var err error
	var p searchParams

	if err = dfr.GetParams(&p); err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Error("Couldn't get parameters")
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	spew.Dump(p)

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
}
```

You'll be able to see that we're effectively retrieving parameters that 
DialogFlow sends to our webhook. We can definitely search for a cocktail which 
matches all these parameters. But then the user enters
the followup intent `Specify` by saying "without alcohol". Well, the 
parameters are now pretty useless because it will only contain the information
of the follow-up and we don't want the user to say again his whole search. 
And that's why DialogFlow creates a context for the follow-up intents !

So let's say we have another function for the `Specify` follow-up intent, 
which will be accessed with the `search.specify` action (remember, the field 
just above the parameters) :

```go
func specify(c *gin.Context, dfr *df.Request) {
	var err error
	var p searchParams

	if err = dfr.GetContext("Search-followup", &p); err != nil {
		logrus.WithError(err).Error("Couldn't get parameters")
		c.AbortWithStatus(http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
	}

	spew.Dump(p)

	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{})
}
```

That looks like our `search` function but this one is based on the context
DialogFlow sets when the user enters the follow-up.

## Sending back contexts

We won't cover this section in this article as it is already **really long**,
but you can send back one or multiple contexts to DialogFlow along with your
messages. Now you can ask : "Why would I do that ? What are the use cases ?"

Well for example if you show your user some results and want him to be able to
go back, go to the next item or select one, you could send back a context
containing a list of ID and a cursor (simple integer that points the current
item the user wants to see). And then while your user is in this loop (which
you'll be able to determine thanks to the `action` field) you'll be able to
retrieve this context, make use of it, potentially alter it and send it back
with the same name. 

To simplify the use and creation of contexts, you can use the 
[`NewContext`](https://godoc.org/github.com/leboncoin/dialogflow-go-webhook#Request.NewContext)
helper which will ensure the correct name of the context.

Note that there's no need to mention these contexts in DialogFlow (in the input
and output sections of your intents). 

# Code

All the code in this article can be found [here](https://github.com/Depado/articles/tree/master/code/dialogflow).
This is not production grade code, there's no configuration management, the
cocktail client is lacking some functions (and the structs are ugly). But that's
something I'll fix later.
